- 👋 Hi, I’m @mobilepadawan
- 👀 I'm interested in Vanilla JavaScript, Progressive Web Apps, mobile software development and the engineering of web browsers engine.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning nothing at all. I teach JavaScript in different coding schools all the time and I'm digging what's new in JS every 6 weeks with every new web browser version.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on teaching areas. I love to teach and I love PWA ecosystem, also Technical Writing is my passion and was my job for almost six years.
- 📫 How to reach me on Linkedin, or here of course. You can read my personal website at www.ferpro.online.
