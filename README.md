- 👋 Hi, I’m @mobilepadawan
- 👀 Vanilla JavaScript is an extension of me. Also the Progressive Web Apps, the mobile software development and the engineering of web browser's engine.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning nothing at all. I teach JavaScript fulltime in a couple of coding schools, a University, and also in a Terciary School. And every six-week-period I digg what's new in JS according to every new chromium web browser version.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on teaching areas. I love to teach and I love the PWA ecosystem: Also the Technical Writing is my passion and it was my job for almost six years.

- 📫 You can reach me on Linkedin or here, of course. You can read my personal website at www.ferpro.online to know other ways to contact me.
