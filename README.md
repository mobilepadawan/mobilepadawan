- 👋 Hi, I’m @mobilepadawan
- 👀 Vanilla JavaScript is an extension of me. Also the PWA's and the weird world of the web browser engines.

- 🎓 I teach very advanced JavaScript, Node JS backend, and SQL in a University, two Associate Tech-School, and some coding schools.

- 📆 I'm also coordinating a Diploma Degrees in a Public University for some cities in Argentina whom are deploying this University Diploma in Frontend Web, Backend, 🔐 Cybersecurity, 🤖 Artificial 🧠Intelligence and QA Testing. My role is to guide the professor and tutor Teams also to provide them educational content and exercises, and to coordinate simultaneous Diploma Degree courses.

- 🧑🏻‍💻 I develop technical content about Frontend, Backend, Cybersecurity and Artificial Intelligence for many EdTech companies and Universities (UNTREF, ISTEA, Educación IT, CODERHOUSE, FUNDACIÓN YPF, TECLAB) among others. To write and to teach are helping me to learn new things at a time.

- 🫶🏼 Since 2024 I'm in a relationship with [ViteJS]([URL](https://vitejs.dev)).

- 📫 You can reach me on Linkedin, by here, also through my personal website at [Vida Mobile](https://www.vidamobile.com.ar).
- 💬 Of course you are free to write me in spanish, english, or italian.
