- 👋 Hi, I’m @mobilepadawan
- 👀 Vanilla JavaScript is an extension of me. Also the PWA's and the engineering of web browser engines.

- 🎓 I teach JavaScript, Node JS backend, and SQL, in a couple of coding schools, a University, and also in an Associate Tech-School.

- 📆 I coordinate since 2021 a Diploma Degree in a Public University for some cities in Argentina whom are deploying this University Diploma in Frontend Web and Backend with Node.js. My role is to guide the professor and tutor Teams, provide them educational content and exercises, and coordinate the simultaneously developing of multiple Diploma Degree courses. (near 10-12).

- 🧑🏻‍💻 I continue to improve my skills by developing technical content for many Argentinian EdTech companies and Universities (UNTREF, ISTEA, Educación IT, CODERHOUSE, FUNDACIÓN YPF (MEDIACHICAS), TECLAB) among others. To write and to teach are helping me to learn new things at a time.
